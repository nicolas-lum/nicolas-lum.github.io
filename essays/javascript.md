First and foremost, I think javascript is an awful as a programming language. When compared to languages like C++ or C, Javascript loses out in terms of memory efficency. When writing recursive functions such as a fibonacci sequence I found that the stack fills up much faster than in C++. Javascript also loses out in the ability to access and assign data to the heap. 

However, I find Javascript to be just as useful as Python 1 on a basic level. Although, when comparing Javascript to to Python 2 or 3 it loses out in it's inability to accept and send command line arguments without an imported library. As someone with intrests in CTF (capture the flag) compettions Python will always be a better choice for it's "out of the box" usability. This is not to say that Javascript is bad, as a web based language it serves its purpose.
