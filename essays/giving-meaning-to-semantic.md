## Fun with frameworks

Have you ever wondered if net frameworks are necessary? Would our jobs suffer if we didn’t have them? To be frank, they would. If you have ever had the pleasure of trying to build a modern professional looking website out of plain HTML and CSS, you know just how much fun that is. Possible? Yes. But not without pulling some hairs out. Frameworks are tools, each is designed to help us fulfill a different purpose. Why use a fork to hammer in a nail? Of course, it’s not like a framework will magically make your website look better or easier to create. Each framework has its own learning curve which can be more or less frustrating depending on the framework your using. However, once you learn said framework then it almost becomes like magic.

## You, I, and SemanticUI

A framework I have had the opportunity to use recently is SemanticUI. In my brief time with it I have had two major revelations. The first one is if you aren’t too keen on UX design. Semantic is really great for simplifying the UX design process. Not to mention it also cuts down the amount of CSS formatting that is necessary. However, if you have experience with frameworks with Bootstrap and WebKit, semantic might be a little bit of a struggle to get what you want. For copying a general design of a website, semantic is by far the easiest framework to do so. However, if you wanted to create something special and unique I would not suggest semantic.
