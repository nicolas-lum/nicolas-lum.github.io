First and foremost, I think javascript is awful as a "programming language". The words "programming language" should be taken with a grain of salt as Javascript is a scripting language and comparing Javascript with something like C is akin to comparing a boat to a plane. When compared to languages like C++ or C, Javascript loses out in terms of memory efficiency. When writing recursive functions such as a fibonacci sequence I found that the stack fills up much faster than in C++. Javascript also loses out in the ability to access the heap. Of course, Javascript has a garbage collector like Java so there's no real need for it to access the heap either. I do find it useful in Javascript that variables can store any sort of primitive data type.  

However, I find Javascript to be just as useful as Python 1 on a basic level. Although, when comparing Javascript to to Python 2 or 3 it loses out in it's inability to accept and send command line arguments without an imported library. As someone with interests in CTF (capture the flag) competitions Python will always be a better choice for it's "out of the box" usability. This is not to say that Javascript is bad, as a web based language it serves its purpose. While I do not have any experience with Javascript for web programming, the language seems very useful.

As far as how "good" or "bad" Javascript is from a software engineering point of view, I find it really comes down to what kind of project I am doing. For something relatively simple and not memory sensitive then Javascript would seem like a choice on par with Java. If however, I wanted to build something that is designed to have scalability, I do not think Javascript would be the most optimal choice.

The use of Javascript in regards to "athletic software engineering" seems to be a good choice. So far, using Javascript in a timed environment has been very beneficial. The benefits can mostly be attributed to the way Javascript handles data types, I do not have to spend as much time considering what sort of data I am passing and how I pass it. 

The WODs themselves are incredibly useful for learning how to deal with a problem on the spot as well as coming up with a working solution quickly. The immediate solution that may come about during a WOD is not always the best it could be, but its always better to have a working solution than none at all. Personally, I find the WODs very stressful and anxiety inducing. I see the merit in having the WODs but I don't know if I will ever be able to fully acclimate myself to the situation they induce.
