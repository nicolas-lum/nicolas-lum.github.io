As someone who likes to dabble around within the hacker community I bear witness to a myriad of questions. Well what kind of questions might a person need to ask a hacker community. The answer, it really doesn’t matter. I have seen questions from people with no technical knowledge to industry professionals. A dumb question is only a dumb question if asked in a dumb way.

So, what exactly is a “bad” question or a “good” question for that matter? A “good” question is one that is already attempted. There is no shame in needing external help once in a while. However, asking another for help should be a last resort and not a first. What the difference essentially boils down to is if you have exhausted other options already. Here is a list of general questions you should ask yourself before posting to a forum; Did you already attempt it? Did you search to see if someone else has had the same question? Have you tried the google? What is the meaning of life? Ok, the last one might be a little unnecessary. In all seriousness you should have done all the footwork necessary before asking a question.

## A good question

The Poster makes it clear that this is a subject he not well versed in but also makes it known what sort of relevant experience he has had. Having this knowledge on hand cut down on the amount assumptions or lack therefore of the answering party has to make. The Poster also makes it clear he is willing to learn in detail. The Poster has made it known that he has put a lot of thought into his question and the responses reply in kind. The question itself is not all that complex. Contrarily, it’s a beginner level question. This proves that any question can be a good question if asked in a right way.

## A bad question
Ever hear people ragging on engineering companies for delivering late and way over budget? Well, some engineering jobs are really difficult, especially if the requirements and funding are undulating underneath you. Because of the nature of the problem, sometimes engineering firms require large amounts of engineers and workers, inviting further problems and delays.

The Honolulu Rail project at home has become this sort of poster child of failure, budget overrun and overall incompetence in Hawaii. Well, working though regulatory boards and fiscal procedures in Hawaii seems like it's a mind bogglingly difficult job to do. Granted, there might be some fishy stuff going on, but I refuse to believe that everyone is involved for nefarious reasons.

The problem of creating an unprecedented public transportation backbone on an island is difficult! I'm not sure we would have done it right, even if the best people were involved.
