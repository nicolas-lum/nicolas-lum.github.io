# Project Event Echo

## Overview
The problem: There are many events that happen at Campus Center but a lot of students don't know what those events are or when they happen.

The solution: An application that allows students to see all planned events and the event information.

# Approach
Once all the event information is gathered put them into a list of events alongside an option for additional information. 
An admin is able to edit, add, or delete events

#Mockup page list:
- Landing page
- Additional information page
- Calender
- Admin page

#Beyond the basics
- Google calender
- Notify students via email about upcoming events
- Facebook "I'm going to this event" integration
- Twitter post integration
- Instagram post integration
