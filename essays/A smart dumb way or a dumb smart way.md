As someone who likes to dabble around within the hacker community I bear witness to a myriad of questions. Well what kind of questions might a person need to ask a hacker community. The answer, it really doesn’t matter. I have seen questions from people with no technical knowledge to industry professionals. A dumb question is only a dumb question if asked in a dumb way.

So, what exactly is a “bad” question or a “good” question for that matter? A “good” question is one that is already attempted. There is no shame in needing external help once in a while. However, asking another for help should be a last resort and not a first. What the difference essentially boils down to is if you have exhausted other options already. Here is a list of general questions you should ask yourself before posting to a forum; Did you already attempt it? Did you search to see if someone else has had the same question? Have you tried the google? What is the meaning of life? Ok, the last one might be a little unnecessary. In all seriousness you should have done all the footwork necessary before asking a question.

## A demonstration of a [“good” question]( https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2139224/how-to-pass-objects-to-functions-in-c/2139254#2139254)

The Poster makes it clear that this is a subject he not well versed in but also makes it known what sort of relevant experience he has had. Having this knowledge on hand cut down on the amount assumptions or lack therefore of the answering party has to make. The Poster also makes it clear he is willing to learn in detail. The Poster has made it known that he has put a lot of thought into his question and the responses reply in kind. The question itself is not all that complex. Contrarily, it’s a beginner level question. This proves that any question can be a good question if asked in a right way.

This question has 30 downvotes for a reason and I can tell you it’s not because it’s a good question. First of all, this question could easily be answered by looking up the documentation. Second, there are probably tons of other websites that have answered this question. It’s also a very vague question which the Poster has not shown any attempt to answer or elaborate on. This question is a beginner level question as well but the amount of time and effort the Poster has put into the asking it is quite low.
