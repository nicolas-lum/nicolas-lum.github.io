## Javascript v.s. The World
Before a proper comparison of Javascript to other traditional programming languages such as C,the fact that Javascript is a scripting language should be taken into consideration. I say this as Javascript is a scripting language in definition only. A breif definiton of a scripting language is that a scripting language is interpreted rather than compiled. 
 

However, I find Javascript to be just as useful as Python 1 on a basic level. Although, when comparing Javascript to Python 2 or 3 it loses out in it's inability to accept and send command line arguments without an imported library. As someone with interests in CTF (capture the flag) competitions Python will always be a better choice for its "out of the box" usability. This is not to say that Javascript is bad, as a web based language it serves its purpose. While I do not have any experience with Javascript for web programming, the language seems very useful for creating client side interfaces beyond what HTML can do.

As far as how "good" or "bad" Javascript is from a software engineering point of view, I find it really comes down to what kind of project I am doing. For something relatively simple and not memory sensitive then Javascript would seem like a choice on par with Java. If however, I wanted to build something that is designed to have scalability, I do not think Javascript would be the most optimal choice.

The use of Javascript in regards to "athletic software engineering" seems to be a good choice. So far, using Javascript in a timed environment has been very beneficial. The benefits can mostly be attributed to the way Javascript handles data types, I do not have to spend as much time considering what sort of data I am passing and how I pass it.
