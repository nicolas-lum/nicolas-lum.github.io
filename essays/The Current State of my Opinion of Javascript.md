First and foremost, Javascript is a strange language. A comparison of Javascript to other traditional programming languages such as C, is akin to comparing a boat to a plane. I say this as Javascript is defined as a scripting language. Even that definition should be taken with a grain of salt as Javascript is only a scripting language as it does not require a main function or a compiler.
When compared to languages like C++ or C, Javascript loses out in terms of memory efficiency. When writing recursive functions such as a fibonacci sequence I found that the stack fills up much faster than in C++. While digging around the native Javascript library I discoverd Javascript also lacks the ability to access the heap. Of course, Javascript has a garbage collector like Java so there's no real need for being able to access the heap either. I do find it useful in Javascript that variables can store any sort of primitive data type. 

However, I find Javascript to be just as useful as Python 1 on a basic level. Although, when comparing Javascript to Python 2 or 3 it loses out in it's inability to accept and send command line arguments without an imported library. As someone with interests in CTF (capture the flag) competitions Python will always be a better choice for its "out of the box" usability. This is not to say that Javascript is bad, as a web based language it serves its purpose. While I do not have any experience with Javascript for web programming, the language seems very useful for creating client side interfaces beyond what HTML can do.

As far as how "good" or "bad" Javascript is from a software engineering point of view, I find it really comes down to what kind of project I am doing. For something relatively simple and not memory sensitive then Javascript would seem like a choice on par with Java. If however, I wanted to build something that is designed to have scalability, I do not think Javascript would be the most optimal choice.

The use of Javascript in regards to "athletic software engineering" seems to be a good choice. So far, using Javascript in a timed environment has been very beneficial. The benefits can mostly be attributed to the way Javascript handles data types, I do not have to spend as much time considering what sort of data I am passing and how I pass it.
