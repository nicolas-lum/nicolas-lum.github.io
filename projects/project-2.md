summary: A simple website I created to store my photos of my travels.

This project is a simple website created in HTML using CSS Templates. It's purpose is to store all the photos I take when I travel. The website was also a simple exercise to help me learn HTML and various CSS elements such as bootstrap. The website is currently not hosted anywhere.
