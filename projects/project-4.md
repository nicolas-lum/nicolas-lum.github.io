---

# What does it do?
Hotfix allows students to self report any issues around campus. Issues like a broken door, or a broken toilet,
or anything else that might need a "hotfix".

# About the Project
This web application was designed alongside Will Post and Kenneth Lauritzen. The whole idea of the project was to allow
studentds to have a voice and maybe even alert UH to issues that they might have missed or bring attention to problems
that are more impactful than they realised.

# Technologies
Hotfix was built using Semantic-React running HMTL/CSS for the front end. Our database was based in mongoDB and hooked up to
Meteor for the live build. 

# My contributions
I designed the logo as well as helped define the database schema. Alot of my time was spent on bugfixes .
